This app was created using Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and the Giphy API. 

The user can click an existing button to view gifs for that animal or they can type in an animal of their choice to add a button. This button can then be clicked to display the gifs of the newly added animal. The gifs populate as a still image and on a click they begin to animate.
